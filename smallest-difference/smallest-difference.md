### Smallest Difference Problem (Iterative Approach)

**Simple Input:**

```javascript
arrayOne = [-1, 5, 10, 20, 28, 3];
arrayTwo = [26, 134, 135, 15, 17];
```

**Simple Output:**

```javascript
[28, 26];
```

#### Programming intuition

Given two non-empty integer arrays, we want to find the pair of elements (one from each array) with the smallest absolute difference. Here's an algorithmic approach to solve this problem:

#### Steps

1. **Sorting Arrays:**

   - Both `arrayOne` and `arrayTwo` are sorted in ascending order using the `.sort()` method. Sorting is essential for efficient comparison.
   - Time complexity for sorting both arrays: $$O(n \log n) + O(m \log m)$$, where:
     - \(n\) is the size of `arrayOne`.
     - \(m\) is the size of `arrayTwo`.

2. **Initialization:**

   - Initialize two pointers: `idxOne` for `arrayOne` and `idxTwo` for `arrayTwo`.
   - Initialize `smallest` and `current` variables to track the smallest difference found so far.
   - Create an empty array called `smallestPair` to store the pair of elements with the smallest difference.

3. **Iterate Through Both Arrays:**

   - While both pointers are within the array bounds:
     - Calculate the absolute difference between the current elements: `current = Math.abs(arrayOne[idxOne] - arrayTwo[idxTwo])`.
     - If `arrayOne[idxOne]` is less than `arrayTwo[idxTwo]`, update `idxOne`.
     - If `arrayTwo[idxTwo]` is less than `arrayOne[idxOne]`, update `idxTwo`.
     - If the elements are equal, return this pair as the smallest difference pair.
     - Update `smallest` and `smallestPair` if the current difference is smaller.

4. **Return the Smallest Pair:**
   - After the loop, return the `smallestPair` array containing the pair of elements with the smallest difference.

### Complexity Analysis:

- **Time Complexity:**

  - Sorting both arrays: $$O(n \log n) + O(m \log m)$$
  - Iterating through both arrays: $$O(n + m)$$
  - Overall time complexity: $$O(n \log n) + O(m \log m) + O(n + m)$$

- **Space Complexity:**
  - We only need additional space for the `smallestPair` array, which is $$O(1)$$ (constant space).
