### Problem Spiral Traverse: Iterative Approach

#### Algorithm Intuition:

Iterate through input two-dimensional array like spiral order and collect each visited element in new one-dimensional array and return it.

1. **Initialization:**

   - We start by initializing some variables:
     - `row` and `col` represent the dimensions of the input two-dimensional array.
     - `visited` is an empty array where we'll collect the visited elements.
     - `rowStart`, `rowEnd`, `colStart`, and `colEnd` are pointers that define the boundaries of our traversal.

2. **Iteration:**

   - We continue the traversal as long as `rowStart` doesn't overlap with `rowEnd` and `colStart` doesn't overlap with `colEnd`.
   - For each step, we perform the following actions:
     - Traverse right: Iterate from `colStart` to `colEnd`, adding each element to `visited`.
     - Traverse down: Iterate from `rowStart + 1` to `rowEnd`, adding each element to `visited`.
     - Traverse left (if applicable): Check if `rowStart` is still less than or equal to `rowEnd`. If so, iterate from `colEnd - 1` to `colStart`, adding each element to `visited`.
     - Traverse up (if applicable): Check if `colStart` is still less than or equal to `colEnd`. If so, iterate from `rowEnd - 1` to `rowStart + 1`, adding each element to `visited`.
   - Update the pointers:
     - Increment `rowStart` and decrement `rowEnd`.
     - Decrement `colEnd`.
     - Decrement `rowEnd`.
     - Increment `colStart`.

3. **Return Result:**

   - After completing the traversal, return the `visited` array containing all the elements in spiral order.

4. **Complexity Analysis:**
   - Time Complexity: O(n) since we visit each element once.
   - Space Complexity: O(n) for the `visited` array.
